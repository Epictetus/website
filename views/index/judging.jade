  ## Want to be an expert judge?

  Expert judges are expected to be high-tech insiders including: founders, CEOs,
  VCs, journalists, open source developers, and others.
  [See last year's judges](http://2010.nodeknockout.com/judging#judges) for
  examples.

  Judges will need to write 2-3 sentence reviews of 5-10 entries, judging
  just functionality (not code) along 4 dimensions: utility/fun, innovation,
  completeness and design. This will take approximately 2-3 hours between
  August 29 and September 5.

  To be a judge, we need your: **name**, **email**, **bio**, and **photo**.
  Please [email us if you're interested](mailto:all@nodeknockout.com).

  Judges are expected to remain impartial, and will not be allowed to cast votes
  on teams they know.
