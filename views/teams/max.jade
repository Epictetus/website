  Exactly how many will be dependent on the number of judges we currently have,
  so [help us find more judges][1].

  ## Details

  To keep the judging quality high we limit the number of teams so that each
  expert judge can provide in-depth feedback.

  If you don't want to wait, a few other options are:

  - Check back later. A team may give up their spot at any time.
  - Try to join an [existing team](/teams).
  - Tweet about your misfortune (be sure to mention [@node_knockout]) and
    we can help you find a team to join.
