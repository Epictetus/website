  Exactly how many will be dependent on the number of judges we currently have,
  so [help us find more judges][1].

  ## Details

  To keep the judging quality high we limit the number of teams so that each
  expert judge can provide in-depth feedback.

  Your options are:

  - Be here at [0:00 GMT] when we open up more spots.
  - Check back randomly. Teams may give up their spot at any time.
  - Try to join an [existing team](/teams).
  - Tweet about your misfortune (be sure to mention [@node_knockout]) and
    we can help you find a team to join.
